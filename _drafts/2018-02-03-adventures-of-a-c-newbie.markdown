Having a little bit too much free time at hands can cause many issues. My case
is not an exception.

Being as windy as I'm usually is, I decided to **change**!

Lo and behold, I made a resolve to improve my Software Engineering skills.
Knowing that it is hard for me to learn from textbooks and theory in general,
I chose to implement something _useful_.

An Idea that stuck to me is to write a web server. Looking around I found a
reasonable resource that describes everything that I need to do - 
[RFC2616][rfc2616]. But surfing around later on the weekend I found
[this][rfc-is-dead] blog post, which I found pretty credible and reasonable
so I decided to target standards mentioned there (With [RFC7230][rfc7230] as 
a starting point).

Next decision I was faced with is the choice of programming language - my main
professional language is Ruby (Yay for comfortable languages!), but I was keen
on doing something unreasonable so I chose C.

Yes my dear reader, C.

**That** language, with manual memory management and loaded revolvers on every
corner. It was probably a bad decision but I imagined that after such hell
training camp I'll come out with bulging muscles. If I'll stay alive,
of course.

Being a complete C newbie I stumbled around looking at different build tools,
testing frameworks, editors - but that's a story for another time.
